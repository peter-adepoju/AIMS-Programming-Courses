    "Our motivational problem is the following: \n",
    " - Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, what numbers $m$ can be written in the form $a\\,x+b\\,y$, where $x,\\,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge0}$? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given positive integers $a$ and $b$ if there is a positive integer $c$, with $c = a\\,x + b\\,y$ such that for all positive integers $n \\ge c$, there are non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ with $n = a\\,x + b\\,y$, then $c$ is called the *conductor* of $a$ and $b$. In other words, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as $a\\,x + b\\,y$ such that  all positive integers greater than or equal to $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ are also writable. We will denote the conductor of $a$ and $b$ by $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$.  \n",
    "On the other hand, the largest positive integer $f$ that can not be written as $f = a\\,x + b\\,y$ is called the  *Frobenius number* of $a$ and $b$. We will denote this by $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has already led to several related questions. Hopefully you were able to explore the following questions and made interesting _conjectures_.\n",

    " - If $a$ is odd and $b$ is odd, what is the Frobenius number? \n",
    " - If $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers, what is the Frobenius number? \n",
    " - Given two positive integers $a$ and $b$, can we find a formula or some other means of computing the Frobenius number?\n",
    " - If $a,\\, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and $\\gcd(a, b) \\neq 1$, does the Frobenius number exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions that we possed together in class: \n",
    "- Given that either $a = 1$ or $b = 1$, but not both, is it possible to define a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$? If so what is it?\n",
    "- If $a$ and $b$ have a common factor greater than $1$, does there exist a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$?\n",

    "- If $f_{\\{a,b\\}}=\\infty$ for $a,\\,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, is it always true that the conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ is also infinity. How about the vice-versa of this statement?\n",
    "- Is there a case such that given $a,\\,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ there exists a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ but not a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$?\n",
    "- What is the existence condition for a Frobenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$ given $a, b\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$?\n",
    "- If $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and there exist a Fronbenius number, $f_{\\{a,b\\}}$ and a conductor, $c_{\\{a,b\\}}$, is there a relationship between:\n",

    "9. For which values of $a$ and $b$ is the sum of their squares a prime number?\n",
    "10. Can there be two or more distinct pairs of $a$ and $b$ that yield the same sum of squares? If so, what are these pairs?\n",
    "11. Is the sum of the squares of two consecutive integers always odd? If not, when does it differ?\n",
