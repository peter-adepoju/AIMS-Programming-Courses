# Experimental Mathematics with SageMath

This repository contains the **code for exercises, assignments, and the final group project** from the *Experimental Mathematics with SageMath* course at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa.

## About the Course
This intensive three-week course introduced a new approach to mathematical problem-solving through experimentation using the SageMath computer algebra system.  

We explored:
- Algebra  
- Combinatorics  
- Number theory  
- Calculus  
- Numerical mathematics  

The course also revisited programming concepts, data types, plotting functions and geometric figures, and creating interactive visualizations.

## Final Project
I contributed to a group project, titled **“Animating the Planets Orbiting Around the Sun Using SageMath,”** which was presented on the last day of the course. iT showcased the potential of the `interact` package for building mathematical visualizations.

## Repository Structure
- `exercises/` – solutions to in-class exercises and homeworks  
- `practice/` – my personal exploration of concepts in sagemath  
- `project/` – final group project (planetary animation)  

## Getting Started
To explore the notebooks, install [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) and open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
